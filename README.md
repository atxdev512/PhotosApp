# Skylight Front End Challenge

## Introduction

For this challenge, you will be completing the implementation of a simple photo manager app. This app should allow the user to manage a 2-column grid of photos.

## Functionality Requirements

Users should be able to select, add, and delete multiple photos at once. Some additional nice-to-have operations include the following:

- Expanding a single photo for larger individual viewing
- Sorting/reordering of photos

## Expected Implementations

- Implement PhotosList organism
- Implement screens to satisfy functionality requirements
- Implement client API logic to facilitate photo management
- Create storybook for any atoms and molecules created
  - Hint: You should probably have at least one or two of these

## Prescribed Implementation Details

- You must use Typescript
- No class components, please
- You must use `@tanstack/react-query` to interact with your client API. Documentation can be found [here](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/installation).

## Help

- Available photos are located in the `assets/photos` directory. You shouldn't need to do anything with them, as they are already being exported as an array of objects for easy referencing.
